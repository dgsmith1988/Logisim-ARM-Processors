#For some reason, Logisim doesn't like having certain inputs as x (or don't care) so they have been hard wired to 0 when isolating functionality to have the test vector work
#This is not an exhaustive test. That would be easier if another intermediate layer which generated the LDRStall and PCWrPendingF signals was created to eliminate the number input combinations to test here
