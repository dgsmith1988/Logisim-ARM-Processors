#Given that this component is meant to be used in a larger context which involves state changes for the inputs to this, oscillations occur in purely combinational testing.
#Accordingly, the signal values will be correct for certain tests, however Logisim will report an error as occuring due to the detection of the oscillations.
#Also, as the ARM_Condition_Check unit was verified in isolation in another test vector, this test is just meant to test the logic which surrounds that block in this module.
